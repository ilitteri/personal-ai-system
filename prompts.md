# Reusable Prompts

Copy-paste these for common tasks.

## Sync Design Docs with Codebase

```
Review the design doc at [path] and compare it against the current implementation. Identify:
- Sections that are outdated
- Missing documentation for new features
- Inconsistencies between doc and code
Update the doc to reflect the current state.
```

## Code Review

```
Review [files/PR] for:
- Correctness and edge cases
- Security concerns
- Performance implications
- Code clarity and maintainability
Provide specific, actionable feedback.
```

## Test After Implementation

```
I just implemented [feature]. Help me:
1. Identify what needs testing (unit, integration, edge cases)
2. Write the tests
3. Run them and fix any failures
```

## Refine and Polish

```
Review [file/feature] and suggest improvements for:
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Code organization
- User experience
Keep changes minimal and focused.
```

## Shareable Summary

```
Give me a brief explanation of this project/system that I can share with others.
Keep it concise, structured, and copy-paste ready.
```

## WIP

```
Read ~/Personal/wip.md and show me a quick summary of my work in progress.
```

## Update WIP

```
Read ~/Personal/wip.md and let me update the status of my work in progress.
Show me current items and ask what changed.
```
